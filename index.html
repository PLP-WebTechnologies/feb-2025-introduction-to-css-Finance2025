    <p>This webpage demonstrates how CSS can be used to style various HTML elements. By using selectors like IDs and classes, we can control the layout, appearance, and spacing of the content.</p>
    <p>Margins and padding are applied to ensure that the content is well-spaced and readable. The image has been styled with borders and padding to give it a polished look. Typography has also been customized to improve readability.</p>
